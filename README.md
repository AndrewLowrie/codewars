This is repo of solutions I have created to complete the kata challenges on the website: https://www.codewars.com/. I have found it extremely beneficial in progressing my rate of learning to program. This is an exercise in documenting my progress as I start to tackle more challenging kata's.

I will only put forward working finished solutions to avoid confusion/clutter.

If you are unfamiliar with the terminology used on code wars, challenges are listed as kata's with difficulty rankings of 8 kyu to 1 kyu, with 8 being the simplest and 1 being the toughest.

29/04/18 Update: re-structured to account for more languages that just ruby moving forward.
